FASHION ISN’T LED BY A SINGLE TREND
ANYMORE—IT’S A POLYCULTURE
MAINSTREAM FASHION TODAY IS A MIX OF SEEMINGLY
CONTRADICTORY MOVEMENTS. INSTEAD OF ONE DOMINANT LOOK,
CONSUMERS TOGGLE BETWEEN:
Balletcore and “loud luxury,” led by the rise of
hybrid forms like the “ballet sneaker.”
Low-profile retro runners for the “quiet luxury” and
minimalist consumer.
Chunky Y2K silhouettes embraced by younger
buyers.
Gorpcore, where functional, technical shoes become
the new status symbol.

STREETWEAR’S EVOLUTION ADDED 
MORE PRESSURE TO “GET IT RIGHT”
THE STREETWEAR CATEGORY—ONCE DEFINED BY REBELLION AND
AUTHENTICITY—HAS FULLY MERGED INTO MAINSTREAM FASHION.
ITS INFLUENCE IS EVERYWHERE, FROM COUTURE RUNWAYS TO
MASS RETAIL.
Several impacts matter for Nike:
Hype still exists, but its meaning has changed.
Streetwear consumers expect exclusivity and
inclusivity. 
They want access, authenticity, and community
not gatekeeping or unattainability

HIGH FASHION FURTHER COMPLICATES THE
LANDSCAPE
LUXURY’S ADOPTION OF SNEAKERS VALIDATED THEM AS STATUS
OBJECTS—BUT IT ALSO RAISED THE STAKES.
Luxury collaborations—like Dior x Jordan—showed how sneakers could become luxury assets, but they also
taught consumers that:
footwear can be “wrong” for
an aesthetic
footwear can be excessively
performative
footwear can lose value if
styled incorrectly

THE SHIFT AWAY FROM “UGLY” SNEAKERS INTO PERFORMANCE-

THE SECONDARY MARKET NO LONGER BEHAVES
LIKE A HYPE MACHINE—IT BEHAVES LIKE A VALUE
MARKET
THE RESALE MARKET USED TO AMPLIFY HYPE. NOW, IT MIRRORS
CONSUMERS’ DESIRE FOR STABILITY AND MEANINGFUL
PURCHASES.
What used to drive resale:
Scarcity
Loud branding
Maximally hyped collaborations
What drives it now:
Quality and longevity
Nostalgia and heritage models
Functionality (Gorpcore)
Quiet luxury, subtle pairs, and classic silhouettes
All captured in the data showing the rise of Asics,
Salomon, and retro runners in the secondary
market

AFTER MAPPING THE SHIFTS ACROSS ALL THREE
SYSTEMS, WE REALIZED SOMETHING CONSISTENT:
CONSUMERS ARE OVERWHELMED BY CHOICE, CONFUSED BY
SHIFTING AESTHETICS, BURNT OUT ON HYPE, AND UNSURE HOW TO
WEAR WHAT THEY OWN.
NIKE RESEARCH: OUR SPECIFIC RESEARCH FOCUS: MARKET & CONSUMERS
THE MARKET HASN’T COLLAPSED BECAUSE PEOPLE LOST INTEREST.
IT’S STALLED BECAUSE PEOPLE LOST CERTAINTY.

CONSUMERS ARE BUYING SNEAKERS THEY

AROUND 40% OF RESPONDENTS OWN 7–10+ PAIRS BUT REALLY
ROTATE JUST 2–3.
Common Reasons:
“They don’t match my outfits.”
“They only work for specific
 occasions.”
“They limit my outfit options.”
“I stick to the same accessories 
 I’m comfortable with.”

WHAT MAKES A SNEAKER “COOL” HAS SHIFTED.
MOST CONSUMERS (ESPECIALLY 35+) RANK “HOW THE SHOE FITS

Common Reasons:
“Rarity” and “status” fall to the bottom for this group.
Younger, hype-driven consumers still value rarity—
but they’re the minority.

NIKE RESEARCH: THE DUPE ECONOMY SHOWS A CONFIDENCE PROBLEM 
40% OF RESPONDENTS HAVE BOUGHT DUPES,
AND THE TOP REASON ISN’T COST.
QUIET LUXURY HAS ALSO NORMALIZED PAYING FOR THE AESTHETIC
RATHER THAN THE LABEL. THIS REINFORCES THE IDEA THAT
CONSUMERS WANT INTEGRATION AND WEARABILITY ABOVE ALL
ELSE.
What we saw:
#1 reason: “I liked the style, not the brand.”
#2 reason: True price barrier.
Survey Quote:
R8: “I wanted the style but didn’t care about the
brand.”

NIKE RESEARCH: THE DUPE ECONOMY SHOWS A CONFIDENCE PROBLEM

NIKE RESEARCH: OBJECTIONS & RESPONSES 
“SCARCITY DRIVES DEMAND.”
MOST PEOPLE NO LONGER RESPOND TO SCARCITY. VINTAGE
MARKETS BEAT SHOCK DROPS BY 78%. DEMAND NOW COMES
FROM CONFIDENCE, NOT HYPE.
“WE’RE A SPORTS BRAND, NOT A FASHION BRAND.”
SNEAKERS ARE NOW IDENTITY ITEMS. CONSUMERS DEPRIORITIZE
PRICE AND COMFORT WHEN BUYING THEM. NIKE CAN LEAD BY
HELPING PEOPLE EXPRESS THAT IDENTITY.
“THIS WILL BE EXPENSIVE.”
THE CURRENT MODEL IS ALREADY CREATING COSTLY ISSUES: RISING
DUPE PURCHASES, LOWER APP ENGAGEMENT, AND UNWORN
PRODUCT. CONFIDENCE-BUILDING INCREASES AOV, LOYALTY, AND
